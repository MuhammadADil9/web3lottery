with the help of automation compatible service we can automate our task in smart contract based on certian conditions or time span. 


it is a decentralized automation service that allow chainlink to execute the task autonomously. 
Its node constantly check  in automation registry to check which upkeeps to perform.
once it identifies that something is about to happen then it automatically send a signed report along with ( peform data ) the same argument that the peformupkeep takes as a argument. 


automation registry keeps the record of the registered upkeeps, rules for executing them and also compensates the developers. 
automation registrar keeps adds the new upkeeps to the registry, act as intermediary between the developers and automation registry. 

there are 4 types of triggers

> log base trigger
> time base trigger 
> condition/custom logic base trigger 













------- Functionality ---------- 

for time base & custom logic trigger we need to make sure our contract is 
> automationCompatible and that it has checkupkeep and performupkeep functions.







-------- way to register contract -----------------

ways to register upkeeps programattically

> make sure that contract has the function check up keep and perform up keep 
> make sure that your contract ( the contract that will register ) have sufficent amount of Link tokens to fund the upkeep 
> it has the address of link token, registry address and registrar adress as per of the current network 

> allow the registar to take the funds from the contract 
> then invoke the function of the registar to register the contract using a struct of appropriate parameters.


---------------------------
deploy your contract on chain and then fund it with sufficient amount of link tokens 
Finally call the specific function to make sure everything works fine
