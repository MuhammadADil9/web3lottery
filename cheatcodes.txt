cheat code for making the address = makeaddr
function for checking the equality = assert 
requirement of assinging money to the duplicated user = vm.deal(player, amount)

how test cases are aligned within the contract that is 
> arrange 
> act 
> assert


for making a specific address responsible for taking on the current call we use = vm.prank()

test ideas for the first function 

function for entering into raffle 

constraints 

there must be minimum balance 
state must be opened 

effects 
first index of array will be filled 
a event will be emitted. 

how many possible test cases can be there ? 
1) everything is correct  Done
2) everything is wrong that is ( there is no balance, no state is opened so no array index was updated) Done
3) balance was there but state was not opened   Done
4) balance wasn't there but state was opened    Done
5) balance and state were all good and it should revert for array not letting the person in. 



--------------
test cases for event in context of enterrafle function 

1 ) events emit itself when the function goes well. Done
2 ) is there any way that we can test that event does not occur. Nope there is no specific way of doing so.
